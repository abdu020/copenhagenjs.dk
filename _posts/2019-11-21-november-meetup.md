## ** Something New **

JS Open mic is a platform that encourages individuals to do shout-outs. We will offer three one-minute slots for people to voluntarily talk about a) community events they are organizing, b) looking for people to join their Open source project, c) their availability for hire, etc. It is NOT for companies to advertise on their products or do head-hunt, but we encourage individuals' self-promoting or community-centric everything.

## What is CopenhagenJS?

CopenhagenJs is a community group in Copenhagen for all JavaScript developers. We get together and share things we work on and really like. We talk about various technologies that we either use on a day to day basis or aspire to use.

## Can I present something at CopenhagenJS?

Definitely, CopenhagenJS is for and by the community, so you are more than welcome to talk about things that you find interesting and we will assist you with your speaking if you are new or have any difficulties. You can contact us with a private message or comment here on meetup.com, or on any social network where you can find us.
